    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Wisemove Legacy Group (Pty) Ltd was founded solely to address the development and economic empowerment of the disadvantaged people of South Africa. Their ambition and motivation is to make South Africa the leader in the empowerment of privatised entrepreneurs within Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wisemove has a pivotal role to play in respect of empowering graduates and Grade 12 school leavers by imparting knowledge and skills through training. The training includes Sales and Marketing skills, Entrepreneurship, Ethics and Financial Literacy, thereby empowering the young leaders with all the skills required to market the dynamic business packages, the roles and skillset learnt will allow them ultimately to create their own business platforms. Wisemove Legacy Group believes that through these valuable skills, fresh intuitive minds, will allow the economy to rise above its current stagnation and move to one of progression. This in turn will enable the wheels of the economy to begin to move fluently again where jobs will be created and ultimately the once disadvantaged person will be able stand on equal ground.   
      </p>

      <h3>Target Market</h3>
      <p>
        The Wisemove Group has a strategy that will encompass every person within a community, they will be targeting the Churches of All Faiths and Denominations. This will create fairness and ease in establishing a National Footprint. The Churches are instrumental within our communities. Wisemove believes that through the Churches we can reach out to educate, motivate and emulate other business people who have succeeded within our great Country. 
      </p>

      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        On completion of all the training mentioned above, the person will receive a business pack and will become an Independent Business Partner (I.B.P) after investing in the business pack. The business pack includes several business opportunities of which the independent business partner (I.B.P) will be authorized to market, included in these business packs are premium products which are more favourably priced then the market norm. We currently have the commitment 300 Pastors belonging to various Churches around KwaZulu Natal, they will all participate in thorough business training, which will in turn allow them to recruit all members from their surrounding communities. We will identify 20 individuals who will undergo intensive training in order to be business managers. Thereafter they will inform and recruit graduates and Grade 12 school leavers from various communities of the Wisemove Business opportunity. The Wisemove business strategy allows them to disseminate some of their profit back down into the Church and its members, there by indirectly empowering them as well.
